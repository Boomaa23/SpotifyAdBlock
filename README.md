# Spotify Ad Blocking Script
**Created by Boomaa (aka Boomaa23 on GitHub)**

A simple script *(made in batch)* to affix ad server addresses to hosts and remove ads on Spotify. If you'd like to use this file, follow these simple steps to get started.
  1. Download **adscript.exe**
  2. Launch adscript.exe
  3. Read the warnings attached to the beginning of the file
  4. Press Y every time a "do you want to overwrite this file?" message comes up (this is planned)
  5. Wait until the file is done writing
  6. Enjoy ad-free spotify!
  
(Optionally you can download adscript.bat and edit the script, but you'll need to run it in administrator mode)
